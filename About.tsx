      <p className="text-lg">
        I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2018, and I have gained valuable experience over the past few years. I began my career as an Apprentice Trainee for two years, where I developed strong problem-solving skills and hands-on experience in engineering practices. Following that, I transitioned into a role as an Accounts Assistant, where I honed my analytical and organizational skills.

        In early 2024, I decided to pivot my career toward software development, driven by a passion for technology and programming. I have since been actively learning programming languages, including C, Java, and MySQL. I am now seeking opportunities to apply my newfound skills in a dynamic software development environment.
